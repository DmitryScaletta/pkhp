Кроме того, в данных бытовках оборудованы комнаты приема пищи --- установлена соответствующая кухонная мебель, имеются холодильник, СВ-печь и электрочайника в каждой. В рамках реализации проекта «Модернизация и реконструкция административного здания и столовой» во 2-ом квартале текущего года была проведена реконструкция столовой предприятия на 50 мест, в том числе обеденного зала, варочного цеха и других вспомогательных помещений. Реконструкция включала замену вентиляции, сантехники, технологического оборудования, мебели, а также проведение отделочных работ. --- Приобретение дополнительно тестомесильной машины позволяет самим изготавливать мучные и хлебобулочные изделия, причем из собственной муки, --- делится радостью заведующая столовой Антонина Ивановна Стефанович. --- Очень популярны у посетителей столовой, а их ежедневно бывает около двухсот человек, блинчики со сметаной. Кстати, в столовой питаются не только работники комбината --- сюда едут люди практически со всего города. И неудивительно, ведь здесь можно вкусно и сравнительно недорого поесть. Да, обед обойдется в 10-12 тысяч рублей. А выбор блюд немалый: ежедневно в меню около семи видов салатов, три вида первых блюд, 11-12 видов --- вторых и так далее, причем предусмотрено и диетическое питание: скажем, салаты из свежей капусты или из свеклы с курагой, молочный суп, филе куриное или цыплята отварные. Словом, вкусно и полезно. --- Комбинат располагает своим медицинским пунктом, основными направлениями работы которого являются: освидетельствование на допуск к работе водительского состава, иммунопрофилактика, первичная (доврачебная) медико-санитарная помощь, --- продолжает рассказ Вадим Леонидович. --- В конце лета текущего года здесь также был окончен ремонт, приобретены новое медицинское оборудование и мебель. После ремонта не узнать прачечную, где установлены три машины, позволяющие быстро стирать и сушить рабочую одежду. В настоящее время проводятся работы по реконструкции санитарно-бытовых помещений сортовой мельницы с разделением их на «чистые» и «грязные» зоны в соответствии с новыми санитарно-гигиеническими требованиями, а также начаты работы по реконструкции помещений производственно-технологической лаборатории. Для улучшения внешнего эстетического вида комбината уже завершены работы по ремонту фасада административного здания. В настоящее время благоустраивается прилегающая территория, а также ремонтируется и красится одно из самых высоких зданий города --- элеватор. На балансе комбината находится общежитие на 83 комнаты. На сегодняшний день заменены сантехническое оборудование и вентиляционная система, начаты отделочные работы по блокам в одной половине здания. Коллективным договором предусмотрен ряд социальных льгот как для работающих, так и для пенсионеров. При наличии выделяются денежные средства и подарки из фонда потребления для поощрения мужчин ко Дню защитника Отечества; женщин --- к 8 Марта; ветеранов Великой Отечественной войны и приравненных к ним лиц --- ко Дню Победы; воинов-интернационалистов --- ко Дню памяти воинов-интернационалистов; пенсионеров, ушедших на пенсию с комбината, --- ко Дню пожилых людей; женщин, имеющих детей, --- ко Дню матери и всех работников --- к профессиональному празднику --- Дню работников сельского хозяйства и перерабатывающей промышленности агропромышленного комплекса, который отмечается в третье воскресенье ноября. Также предусмотрена выплата материальной помощи работникам, достигшим юбилейной даты пенсионного возраста (женщины 55 лет, мужчины --- 60 лет). Кроме того, были дополнительно изысканы средства для оказания работникам комбината единовременной материальной помощи к Новому году, а воспитывающим детей --- также и к 1 сентября. Хочется отметить тот факт, что такая помощь оказывается лишь тем работникам, которые надлежащим образом выполняют свои должностные обязанности и не имеют административных и дисциплинарных нарушений в течение года. В подведомственных магазинах «Нива» по улице Брестской и «Колос» по улице Индустриальной для работников комбината предусмотрен расчет за приобретенный товар путем удержания из заработной платы по ведомости, предоставленной бухгалтерией. Организовываются поездки за грибами и ягодами, экскурсии. В этом году, например, была предоставлена возможность съездить в соседнюю страну и побывать в Киево-Печерской лавре и городе Хмельницком. Также выделяются денежные средства на организацию и проведение культурно-массовых и спортивных мероприятий. Словом, на Пинском комбинате хлебопродуктов в центре внимания --- забота о человеке. Ей в жизни везет на хороших людей У каждого человека своя судьба. Одного как-то перекати-поле носит по белу свету: сегодня он здесь --- завтра там. А кто-то на одном месте пускает корни, и никакие жизненные ураганы ему не страшны. Татьяна Всеволодовна САДЮКОВИЧ (на снимке) родом с Минщины. После окончания в 1965 году политехнического техникума, получив диплом техника-технолога мукомольного производства, она по распределению попала на Пинский мукомольный комбинат (именно так именовался Пинский комбинат хлебопродуктов до 1975 года). С ним и связала свою жизнь, отработав здесь 40 с лишним лет. Несмотря на имевшийся диплом специалиста, ее приняли на работу на обойную, или как теперь ее здесь называют, старую мельницу (ее «останки» еще можно лицезреть на улице Брестской) обычной рабочей. Через четыре месяца стала мастером смены, и в этой должности проработала до 1971 года. После чего перешла старшим лаборантом в центральную производственно-технологическую лабораторию --- к этому времени она уже обзавелась семьей, в которой росли дочери --- старшая Жанна и младшая Ирина. Им, естественно, требовались мамины внимание, ласка, забота. Ну, а в лаборатории работать было полегче, свободных минуток выдавалось побольше. В 1977 году ее попросили поработать на обойной мельнице инженером-технологом (четыре года учебы в техникуме тогда давали учащимся возможность основательно подготовиться к будущей работе). И она согласилась, хотя в лаборатории ей очень нравилось --- и коллектив подобрался отличный, и работа не пугала однообразием, ведь нужно было работать с поступавшим зерном, определяя его влажность, засоренность, стекловидность, содержание клейковины и другие показатели, словом, устанавливать хлебопекарные качества, чтобы знать, куда его разместить и на какие цели использовать. Приходилось контролировать работу цехов, элеватора, сортовой и обойной мельниц, рассчитывать помольные партии, делать многое другое. И это было ей по душе. Тем не менее, повторю, она согласилась и работала инженером-технологом до 1980 года. За эти годы приходилось решать не только производственные вопросы, она не могла пройти мимо людских проблем --- если была возможность, помогала разобраться с ними. Стоит ли удивляться, что именно ее избрали освобожденным председателем профсоюзного комитета комбината. В лабораторию она смогла вернуться только в 1988 году, правда, теперь в должности заместителя ее начальника. Оттуда и пошла на заслуженный отдых. Татьяна Всеволодовна считает, что в жизни ей очень повезло: судьба свела ее с замечательными людьми --- Иваном Лукьяновичем Пицухой, Юрием Ивановичем Киктенко, Александром Леонидовичем Мозолем, Натальей Масальской, Надеждой Суховой, Таисией Ворониной и многими другими. Они не просто шли рядом: кто-то делился с ней секретами профессионального мастерства, кто-то учил премудростям жизни, кто-то поддерживал дружеским советом. И за это Татьяна Всеволодовна благодарна им. Сейчас она на пенсии, в настоящее время больше живет в Мозыре, где помогает растить внучку, чем в Пинске, но когда возвращается домой и есть возможность, она встречается с бывшими коллегами. Они не забывают друг друга, помнят о них и на предприятии. Для людей, ушедших на заслуженный отдых с комбината, всегда находятся и доброе слово, и подарок к праздникам. Вот и ко Дню пожилых пенсионеров ждет приятный сюрприз.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: 7,\r\n        title: 'Капитальный ремонт на сортовой мельнице',\r\n        date: '19.07.2012',\r\n        text: `С 23.07.12 по 13.08.12 на мельнице сортового помола становится на капитальный ремонт.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: 6,\r\n        title: 'Завершение капитального ремонта на комбицехе',\r\n        date: '16.07.2012',\r\n        text: `\r\n09.07.12г. завершён капитальный ремонт линии по производству рассыпных комбикормов.\r\n\r\n16.07.12.г. запущена в эксплуатацию линия гранулированных комбикормов.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: 5,\r\n        title: 'Начало массовой заготовки',\r\n        date: '29.06.2012',\r\n        text: `\r\n29.06.12 подписан приказ \"О начале массовой заготовке зернаурожая 2012г.\" с 09.07.12г.\r\n\r\nПо состоянию на 18.07.12 на комбинат поступило...... тонн зерна.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: 4,\r\n        title: 'Капитальный плановый ремонт',\r\n        date: '22.06.2012',\r\n        text: `\r\nС 21.06.12 по 09.07.12 - капитальный плановый ремонт линии производства рассыпных комбикормов.\r\n\r\nС 22.06.12 по 13.07.12 - капитальный ремонт линии гранулирования.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: 3,\r\n        title: 'Газация',\r\n        date: '23.06.2012',\r\n        text: `C 23 июня произведена газация элеватора и сортовой мельницы.`,\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        id: 2,\r\n        title: 'Подготовка к заготовке',\r\n        date: '24.06.2012',\r\n        text: `20-21 июня была произведена приемка материально-технической базы для заготовки зерна урожая 2012.

В 1946 году был построен зерновой склад, а в 1949-м - выбойное отделение. В 1953 году производство - впервые в Советском Союзе - было переведено на пневматический транспорт. Пинский мелькомбинат № 13 был создан в сентябре 1958 г. на базе мельзавода по производству обойной муки, реализационной базы «Загот-зерно» и бывшей сенобазы «Заготзерно». В следующем году на территории реализационной базы был введен в действие завод «МУКЗ» по производству 35 тонн комбикормов в сутки.\r\n\r\nВ 1966 году началось строительство объектов нового комбината: элеватора на 64 тыс. тонн зерна, мельницы 3-сортного помола производительностью 245 т/сутки и комбикормового цеха производительностью 200 т/сутки, склада силосного типа на 5300 тонн, мелассной установки емкостью 500 тонн, цеха отходов, ремонтно-механической мастерской, лабораторного корпуса, клуба на 200 человек, административного здания и других. В 1975-м мелькомбинат был переименован в комбинат хлебопродуктов. На следующий год началось строительство цеха по производству карбамидного концентрата, Затем строительство было законсервировано, и лишь в 1990-м развернулось переоборудование этого цеха под 2-секцион-ную мельницу по переработке ржи с секциями по выработке муки ржаной обдирной и ржаной обойной с суточной производительностью по 120 т/сутки каждая.\r\n\r\nВ 1993 году 2-секционная мельница вступила в эксплуатацию, а на следующий год был выведен из эксплуатации цех по производству обойной муки.\r\n\r\nВ 1996 году Пинский комбинат хлебопродуктов преобразован в открытое акционерное общество. До 2004 года в результате реорганизации к ОАО «Пинский комбинат хлебопродуктов» на правах производственных участков присоединены Лунинецкое и Столинское хлебоприемные предприятия.\r\n\r\nВ 2004 году завершено техническое перевооружение мельницы сортового помола пшеницы. В результате изменился выход муки по сортам. Отбор муки высшего сорта, в частности, увеличен с 10 до 40 процентов. Расширился ассортимент выпускаемой продукции: крупы манной, отрубей пищевых.\r\n\r\nС целью увеличения ассортимента фасованной продукции в 2008 году предприятием была приобретена и введена в эксплуатацию новая автоматическая линия по фасовке и упаковке продукции «ltalPask-50/5». Мука на линии фасуется в пакеты емкостью 1, 2 и 5 килограммов.\r\n\r\nВ 2009 году в эксплуатацию введен зерносушильный комплекс КЗСВ-40. В 2010 и 2011 годах в комбикормовом цехе произведена замена трех старых линий гранулирования на две новые, более производительные и энергоэкономичные.\r\n\r\nВ настоящее время в состав комбината входят:\r\n\r\n* элеватор емкостью 64 тыс. тонн со встроенной сушилкой ДСП-16;\r\n* мельница сортового помола пшеницы производительностью 130 т/сутки с общим выходом муки 75 % и отбором крупы манной;\r\n* комбикормовый цех производительностью 480 т/сутки комбикормов со складом силосного типа на 3600 тонн;\r\n* 2-секционная мельница по производству муки ржаной обдирной и сеяной производительностью 90 т/сутки с выходом 70 % муки всего, в т. ч. муки ржаной обдирной 20 % и ржаной сеяной 50 %;\r\n* Лунинецкий производственный участок со складами для хранения сортовых семян, рядового зерна и готовой продукции общей емкостью 21000 тонн;\r\n* Столинский производственный участок со складами емкостью 15730 тонн;\r\n* Хлебный городок со складами;\r\n* торговая сеть (столовая, 4 магазина);\r\n* в собственности комбината имеется поголовье свиней в количестве 13,6 тысяч голов.\r\n\r\nМельница сортового помола и цех двухсекционной мельницы оснащены современным технологическим оборудованием.\r\n\r\nКачество вырабатываемой продукции и поступающего сырья в полном объёме контролируется производственно-технологической лабораторией, оснащённой современным оборудованием, позволяющим проводить любые анализы.\r\n\r\nКомбикормовый цех вырабатывает все виды комбикормов для птицы, свиноводческих комплексов, рыбы и КРС.\r\n\r\nКачественная продукция ОАО «Пинский комбинат хлебопродуктов» высоко ценится потребителями не только Республики Беларусь, но и Украины, Молдовы, России.\r\n`;\r\n\r\nexport default page;\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/api/pages/history.js","const page = `\r\n## ОАО «Пинский комбинат хлебопродуктов»\r\n\r\n![](http://www.pkhp.by/pics/index000011.jpg)\r\n`;\r\n\r\nexport default page;\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/api/pages/main.js","const page = `\r\n## Качество\r\n\r\n#### ПОЛИТИКА ОАО «ПИНСКИЙ КОМБИНАТ ХЛЕБОПРОДУКТОВ» В ОБЛАСТИ КАЧЕСТВА И БЕЗОПАСНОСТИ\r\n \r\n___Наш девиз:___ Качество и безопасность продукции - залог нашего успеха.\r\n\r\n___Наша цель:___ Выпуск безопасной продукции высокого качества и по доступной цене, удовлетворяющей требования потребителя.\r\n \r\n___Задачи в достижении постоянной цели:___\r\n\r\n1.
